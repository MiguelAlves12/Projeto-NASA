					<h1> Propulsion and Attitude Control </h1>
					&nbsp
					  <p>	Given the need to follow the spacecraft under analysis for long periods, a positioning and
					  locomotion system with high accuracy, repeatability and low supplies needs (fuel) was required.
					  To achieve these goals, our robot uses two technologies: micro-nozzles driven by compressed
					  air and a set of reaction wheels. </p>
					  <p>The four reaction wheels used in our design ensure agile turns and extra redundancy for
					  malfunctions. They work by storing angular momentum by rotating a steel disk at high speed
					  and, as necessary, decreasing or increasing its speed. Each disk is kept in motion by a brushless
					  DC motor, ensuring high energy efficiency and service life.</p>
					  <p>Micro-nozzles are used with a gaseous mixture maintained under high pressure (approximately
					  4 to 6 atm. was stipulated), which can be breathable air from the spacecraft or methane – one
					  of the by-products of the air treatment process (currently without use). They are controlled by
					  solenoid valves and can generate up to 1 N. of thrust. Our design has eight micro-nozzles that
					  along with the reaction wheels, can move and rotate the robot in any direction..</p>

					  <p>The use of such technologies is only possible due to the microgravity and high vacuum
					  environment where the robot must operate, where there are no friction losses and where there
					  is no need to fight the force of gravity.</p>
					  <p>The robot’s pressurized gas tank can be easily refilled by the crew once inside the main
					  spacecraft, and its simple design (no hypergolic fuels or multiple moving parts) ensures a long
					  life and the confidence needed to be used near manned spacecraft.</p>

					  <p>The robot’s on-board computer is calibrated during launch, and after that maintains its current
					  position using accelerometers and gyroscopes. Eventually, in longer duration operations, its
					  position can be upgraded via radio from the spacecraft..</p>
					  <p>Expected maximum speed shall be equal to or less than 1.0 meter per second for safety
					  reasons. In the event of a collision with the main spaceship, the robot should be with sufficiently
					  low speed in order to not damage it.</p>
