					<h1> HACKATHON </h1>
					&nbsp
					  <p>“Hackathon is an event that brings together programmers, designers and other professionals
					  connected to software development for a marathon programming, whose goal is to develop
					  software that meets specific purpose or free projects that are innovative and usable.”</p>
					  <p>NASA, together with FATEC-OSASCO, have promoted a hackathon in São Paulo, Brazil, to
					  develop solutions to real problems encountered by NASA today. We, Asgardians decided to
					  participate to test our knowledge, not only in software development, but mainly in the
					  development of the robotic and optical designs that the challenge “Design by Nature”
					  proposes; while still meeting with new people from all over our country.</p>

				   <h1> Problem Description </h1>
				   &nbsp
					  <p>The “Design by Nature” contest by NASA challenges us to solve the problem of 
					  micro-meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) using nature’s solutions and as an inspiration source to
					  create a robotic project capable of following an inspection routine with precision in space.</p>
						<p>Expeditions like Apollo 13 or STS-107 were lost due to the lack of identification of external
						 damages in the spacecraft. With the intention of going further and further into space,
						 eventually arriving on Mars, the need to monitor what happens outside the structure that keeps 
						 humans alive is very important.</p>
						<p>The goal of this challenge is to create a reliable and autonomous monitoring system for
						detecting micrometeoroids impacts on spaceships.</p>

				   <h1> The Project </h1>
				   &nbsp
					  <p>The project consists of developing a free-flyer style, autonomously operated robot with a
					  camera system. Our main purpose is to scan the entire spacecraft profile and create a 3D model
					  of its structure for comparison with the existing CAD model. Overlapping both data sets allows
					  us to identify where micro-meteoroid impacts occurred. </p>
					  <p>Taking inspiration from the marine environment, we analyzed the relationship that a cleaning
					  fish (clownfish) has with the reef. According to an article from Unicamp[1] the existence of a reef
					  depends directly on the cleaning that the clownfish realizes. This is a concept of symbiosis
					  known as mutualism, where two different species need each other in order to survive. Another
					  concept of symbiosis is commensalism, where one species is a beneficiary and the other has no
					  benefits, but also has no losses. Our solution is a system inspired by commensalism, in which
					  the main spacecraft is completely benefited by the sweep of our robot, and at the same time
					  possess no detriment to our robot. </p>
					  <p>For scanning the structure, we used optical metrology, inspired by the type of hunting done by
					  eagles – with an outstanding quality of vision that, with a determined search pattern, has great
					  hunting capacity to small and large species – both that can be compared to the goal of this project.</p>
					  <p>For estimates, we assumed that the inspected ship would be NASA’s upcoming Orion capsule,
					  fullfed with additional modules for long-range trips. We assumed a 5.0 meter diameter ship
					  with 41.0 m. length.</p>
